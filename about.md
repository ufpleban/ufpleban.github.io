# About

Uwe's blog on interesting technologies, with some remarks on potential social implications. Opinions are mine, and sometimes I am opinionated. 

The title of my blog is a variation of Arthur C. Clarke's famous statement '*Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic*.' It reflects my hypothesis that advanced NLP programs like GPT-3 have superb pattern matching capabilities, which at times make it appear that they can reason, but that human reasoning is still out of their reach.
